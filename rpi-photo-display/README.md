A simple raspberry pi based image display for an exhibition.
All the media materials are copyrighted and should not be used by any third-party.

To set up the photo viewer, download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) software and burn the legacy os onto the sd card.
The code assumes there is an `adlugosz` user and will attempt to run from that home directory.

After this is done execute the commands in the [setup.sh] file in order to prep the os.

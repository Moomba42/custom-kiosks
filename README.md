This repository was made for a simple raspberry pi based audio player for an exhibition.
All the audio materials are copyrighted and should not be used but any third-party.

To set up the audio player, download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) software and burn the legacy os onto the sd card.
The code assumes there is an `adlugosz` user and will attempt to run from that home directory.

After this is done execute the commands in the [setup.sh] file in order to prep the os.
